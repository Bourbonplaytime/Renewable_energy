# Renewable_energy
An analysis of energy statistics to asses the impact of renewables

This project will use Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and a plotting framework to create visualizations about US energy trends in a 
variety of sectors(wind, solar, hydro, etc.) The idea is to assess the progress of renewable energy in the US. My original dataset
was 123MB which is over Github's file size limit so I had to select solely US statistics and write my own customized CSV. I'd like to do
side by side comparisons with other countries as this progresses. I also aspire to create a Front End interface where different statistical
categories could be selected via drop down menus to show different visualizations. The idea would be to accomplish this using HTML, SASS 
and a Python Framework like Flask.
