# Renewable_energy
An analysis of energy statistics to asses the impact of renewables

This project will use Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib and Plotly to create visualizations about US energy trends in a 
variety of sectors(wind, solar, hydro, etc.) Plotly visualizations do not show on github so to see these you have to download the Plotly package (with conda use conda install -c plotly plotly=4.5.4 or with pip use pip install plotly==4.5.4) and the repo and open them locally. The idea is to assess the progress of renewable energy in the US. My original dataset was 123MB which is over Github's file size limit so I had to select solely US statistics and write my own customized CSV. I'd like to do side by side comparisons with other countries as this progresses. I also aspire to create a Front End interface where different statistical categories could be selected via drop down menus to show different visualizations. The idea would be to accomplish this using HTML, SASS and a Python Framework like Flask.
